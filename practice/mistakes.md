# IELTS Task 1 Writing Mistakes

## Spelling Errors
- "percentange" instead of "percentage"
- "surprass" instead of "surpass"

## Grammar Errors
- Subject-verb agreement: "The washing machines occupies" (should be "occupy" or "The washing machine occupies")
- Inconsistent tense usage throughout (mixing present "occupies" with past "increased")
- Incomplete sentences: "The Internet has started from 10% to 50%" (missing information about timeframe)
- Run-on sentences with comma splices: "during the whole period of time, it starts from"
- Imprecise expressions: "The Internet has started from 10% to 50%"

## Content/Accuracy Errors
- Inaccurate reporting: The computer is described as increasing "from 40% in 1995 to 60% in 1998," but according to the graph, it reaches closer to 70% by 1999
- Imprecise comparison: "The Internet percentage is under DVD player during a small period of time, and they are the same and later is above it" (unclear wording)
- Some data points seem to be misread from the graph

## Structure Problems

- Poor paragraphing with no clear organizational strategy (only two paragraphs)
- Information presented as separate statements rather than a cohesive analysis
- Abrupt transitions between sentences
- No logical grouping of technologies with similar patterns

## Format Issues
- The response appears shorter than the required 150 words
- No conclusion or summary statement
- Lacks appropriate cohesive devices to connect ideas

## Missing Elements
- No analysis of the overall pattern or significance of technological adoption
- Limited meaningful comparisons between the technologies
- No mention of specific rates of growth (which technologies grew fastest/slowest)
- No clear highlighting of the most significant features of the graph
- No discussion of the starting and ending points for each technology to show the full picture
