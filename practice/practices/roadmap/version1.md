Some of my audiences message me and ask : what’s the best roadmap to learn web3. 

I just told them : The best roadmap is in Job Description.  

Becasue If you ask this question: It means that You don’t want to waste your time . You want to master these skills as soon as you can. So that you can get your desired job. 

So in this case, Job description is definitely the best roadmap. 

It gives you the framework and What they emphasis on ?  

So All you need to do is go to the job application platforms , get the most frequently occurred key words. That’s the key requirement you need to fulfill. 

So, If you want to get the information with the highest quality, go to the source of information.


We also believe there is a best solution out there.
All I need to do is to find it first, and follow it. 
No, That's totally wrong. The only thing you should do
is go start it, move your first step, and the solution will come to you.  
Some people are obsessed with finding the answers from these so called authority. The suggestion they gave may not fits you. Let's me show you a picture [大长腿河里], You will understand what I mean. 
So , you have to find your own answer, don't be trapped by the so called authority.
