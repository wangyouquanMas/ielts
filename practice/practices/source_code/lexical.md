## 9. Overall Assessment

According to IELTS Band 8-9 criteria, a wide range of vocabulary should be used accurately with natural control of lexical features. The text demonstrates:

- Frequent basic spelling errors
- Limited range of vocabulary for technical discussion
- Inconsistent terminology
- Imprecise word choices
- Lack of sophisticated lexical cohesion devices

These issues significantly impact clarity and would likely place the writing in Band 5-6 for Lexical Resource, despite the writer's evident knowledge of the subject matter. To reach Band 8-9, the text would need:

- Consistent and accurate spelling throughout
- Precise technical vocabulary
- A wider range of connecting phrases
- More sophisticated and varied vocabulary choices
- Better control of collocations and idioms
- Greater precision in word choice
