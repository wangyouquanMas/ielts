## Practice Lesson: Understanding Go Channels through Source Code

This is a practice lesson. I will provide a highly specific demonstration—using Go channels, a core feature of the Go programming language—to help you understand how to read source code efficiently and effectively.

At the outset, it is important to formulate a question. What would you like to know about channels? Do you already have any questions in mind?  
If you do, excellent—we can move on to the next stage. If not, you must generate a question first. If you find it difficult to create one yourself, you can ask ChatGPT to suggest a question.

**[Open ChatGPT]**

For example, you might ask:  
> What are the core features of Go channels?

**[GPT Response]**

Now, we have identified several core features.

**[2/8]**

However, it is important to understand that the response we obtained is comprehensive—it includes everything the AI considers important. Should we attempt to study all of these features in detail?  
Of course not. We must focus on the most critical feature because our resources are limited, and we need to allocate them wisely.

At this point, I would like to introduce a classic concept: the 80/20 principle. This principle suggests that 20% of your effort can yield 80% of the results.  
Similarly, we should focus only on the most significant feature. Now, let us optimize our question:

> Among the features listed, which do you consider the most important?

After reviewing, we identify one key feature: **goroutine pause and resume**.

---

## [Don’t Fool Yourself]

Now, let us examine this feature carefully. We need to understand its definition and underlying meaning.

Our goal is to deepen our understanding of Go channels by reading the source code.

If you do not fully understand this feature, your learning process will be like a boat adrift without a destination.

Ask yourself:  
> Do I understand this feature?

There are only two possible answers: "No, I do not," or "Yes, I do."  
If your answer is "No," you must work to resolve this gap first.

## [Example: From Abstract to Concrete]

When dealing with abstract concepts, one of the most effective methods is to create a practical demonstration—to move from abstraction to concreteness.

Ask ChatGPT to create an MVP (Minimum Viable Product)—a basic, relevant demonstration.

Very well, let us proceed.

We can use tools such as Cursor or ChatGPT; either is fine. Now, we have the demonstration.

Let us run the demo and test it.  
Now, we understand what this feature entails.

In short:  
- When the channel is full, the goroutine will be **blocked**.  
- When the channel is no longer full, the goroutine will **resume**.

Our question thus becomes even more specific.

---

## [Assumption and Hypothesis]

Do not rush to examine the source code just yet. View it as a journey.  
It is far more beneficial to test your hypotheses and compare your thinking against the source code later—you will gain much more from this process.

Now, ask yourself:  
> If I had to design this pause-and-resume feature, what would I do?

---

## [Simplify the Question]

If the question still feels too complex, simplify it further:  
> Suppose you were tasked with designing a feature—what is the first thing you would do?

Remember:  
All features are ultimately implemented through **data structures** and **algorithms**.  
Thus, we can approach the problem from this perspective.

- We need to **pause** the goroutine and **resume** it later.  
- Therefore, we need a **data structure** to temporarily store goroutines.

There are many possible options: an array, a list, a stack, a queue, and so on.

A queue seems reasonable.  
Thus, we decide to use a **queue** to temporarily store goroutines.

Now that we have determined the data structure, let us consider the **algorithm**:

- If the channel is full, place the current goroutine into the queue.
- When the channel has available space, wake the goroutine and make it runnable again.

This approach sounds actionable, correct?

## [Emerging Questions]

However, some important questions still remain:

1. Who controls the goroutine’s pause and resume behavior?
2. What happens to the task submitted by the goroutine while it is paused?
3. What happens to the task when the goroutine is resumed?
4. When the goroutine sends a value to the channel, do we need a lock?

And so on.  
As you continue asking questions, more detailed inquiries will naturally arise.

## [Now, It’s Time for the Source Code]

At this stage, it is appropriate to examine the source code.  
We now have a rich set of valuable questions related to our learning objectives.

Each question will guide you in the right direction, and answering them will bring you closer to your goal.  
Step by step, the "fog" surrounding the concept will clear.

## [It’s Not Enough]

Reflect on your observations:  
- Which designs impressed you—ones you would not have thought of yourself?  
- Can you apply these ideas to your daily work?

---

## [Summary]

Reading source code is much like memorizing new phrases or expressions in a specific context.  
The context makes each expression meaningful.

Similarly, the more phrases or expressions you know, the more articulate you can become.  
The same principle applies to source code.

The **mindsets**, **design principles**, and **algorithms** you learn through source code will expand your imagination and broaden your toolbox, making you more confident when facing challenges.
