lesson3: I want to talk about how to pass message through channel between goroutines.  
First of all, Let's talk about the background  . As we all know , Helius provides two methods to provide information. We use websocket to get the latest slot.  But that is not enough ,we also need to guarantee the real time . So we should use asynchronous to get and process data which leads to concurrence management. We will use the producer and consumer model.  Specificy, we use channel and goroutine to implement it.  So in this lesson, I will teach you the basic channel and goroutine usage. Then I will provide you the unit test for each feature. You also need to do it by yourself after this lesson.  Now let's get started.
