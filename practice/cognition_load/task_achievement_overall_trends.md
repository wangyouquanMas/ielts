Mistakes I made Task achievement:

No introduction or overview statement summarizing the key trends
- No analysis of the overall pattern or significance of technological adoption


How do you identify the overall Pattern first ? 
- I always start by stepping back to see the "big picture" before diving into details. This becomes my overview paragraph.

Example from the answer:
> "Overall, there was a clear upward trend in the adoption of all technologies by the end of the period, although they followed different patterns of growth and started from significantly different baseline levels."
