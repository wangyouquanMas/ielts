Principle of content optimization：
1. Your audience doesn't want information. They want a transformation. 
2. Don't stuff them up with theories. Show them practicals that can change their situations.
3. They want solutions to their problems. Give them solutions that will help them transform for the better.
4.Facts don’t change people.Stories do. Struggles do.
Seeing themselves in your words does.Information educates.Emotion transforms.
5. Your audience loves to be shown instead of told.
6. Clarity with purpose beats data overload.
7. Shift your focus from just educating to truly inspiring and creating change
8. Someone out there is scrolling, heart heavy, head full, hoping your words will hit different.
Not teach. Not preach. Just reach.
That’s the difference between noise and change.
9. People follow stories they either relate to or want to become.
10. they can google, or even better use AI for information, it's easily available
if your writing doesn't bring anything more than plain info, you're doomed!
11. Impactful writing can inspire transformation, which is what the audience craves. They are focused on outcomes, not just raw information.
12. Facts fills heads, but crafting transformations changes lives.

Write to remake your reader, not just inform them.
13. There’s google and chatgpt for information.

People want context
14. If you content/product doesn’t transform them, they won’t be interested 

You don’t sell them the product but the outcome
15. Your information has no meaning if your audience can't see a transformation in it.

Don't just create for them to read, create for them to see.

16. Nah, they don’t want ‘transformation’ either.  

They want to feel like they’re transforming while scrolling in pajamas.  

Your job:

Make the first step so stupid easy they can’t say no.

17. The cost for someone's attention is transactional for their desire. Find what that is. Deliver it well.


18. Replace (Here’s how) with.
This is how I did it.
