\begin{quote}
"Instead of trying to do two things at once, which was to be clear and to be impressive, I just tried to be clear. As we all know, when you read something that is really clear, after you finish reading it, you say, wow, that was impressive, and that's the way it works, clarity first."
\end{quote}

"Finish over perction means don't try to judge yourself while you are doing. Finish first and iterate on it and make it better"

"Learn from the best writers you admire:
I would recommend looking closely at the openings of papers that you like, perhaps copying the opening paragraph down longhand. I would also recommend underlining words that he uses that you might not use but you can consider using. I would recommend you study your writer's sentence length. How long are his sentences? What is the pattern of long sentences and short sentences that your a hero uses? I would recommend looking for a sentence that he wrote that you would think you could never write because it's not in your nature, and then go and write that sentence out long end a couple of times. Study what you admire"

"So what if you're writing a paper on a scientific topic which focuses around something like molecules. They're too small to be dropped on your foot. How can you make that somehow more concrete? ï¼š
Good writers are always thinking of their readers. A good writer is thinking, how's my reader going to understand this? A good writer is thinking, what is my reader going to see in his head when he reads my words?
So this can produce a problem if you're writing on a scientific topic say about molecules. After all molecules are too small to be dropped on your foot. There's no excuse to stop thinking physically. You can if you're writing about a simple molecule like the molecule of water. You can make a visual metaphor, a grapefruit with two lemons attached to it can stand for H_2O, or you can go looking for the physical objects that are related to the chemical research you're writing about. You can put in as appropriate test tubes or bunsen burners or beakers or spectrophotometers or the laboratory bench. It's a skill to go looking for physical correlates to your topic. But it's a skill that you can get good at pretty quick, and it pays off because you always want to give the reader something to see. I think that's very helpful advice."

"A student who doesn't have enough to say, has often gotten too tense in trying to say something important. It's a good idea to stop trying to say something important than just try to say something simple and clear,
Another thing to do is to write some questions down for yourself. You don't have to be an expert on what you're writing about. You just have to be clear. Write down what puzzles you, write down what confuses you.
I am confused about X, I am puzzled about how X relates to Y. Write these things down, cover several pieces of paper with ideas and sketches. It can even look like this. Tape them together, cover a bunch of paper with notes, tape them together, set them down on your desk and go out for a half an hours walk. When you come back, start again. You will have more ideas. I like that approach."

"In terms of readability, I would suggest using short sentences. A writer ought to go into this paper and if he has written any really long sentences, ask himself if these sentences have to be this long and replace them with shorter sentences.
In terms of completeness, a writer can do two things. It's asking himself a couple of questions. The first one is, what am I trying to say? Did I say it clearly? The second one is, what must I not leave out? The very last question which is, what must I make sure not to leave out? It's very useful. I use it myself all the time as I get to the end of the draft and then ask myself, did I cover everything in particular? Is there anything I must make sure not to leave out? Often it turns out I have left out something important."
