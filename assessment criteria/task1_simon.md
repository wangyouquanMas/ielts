IELTS Writing Task 1 lesson 1
in this lesson I'll quickly explain
what we're going to do
on this video course for writing Task 1
similar to what we did for Task 2 in the Task 2 lessons
my aim is to give you methods and techniques
to look at the task
to break it into parts
and to give you a good approach
good methods for those parts
so for example
of course
we'll look at the different types of writing task
one question a few things to remember before we start
the writing task 1
the task is to describe
a figure some kind of
graph chart diagram that you see
your task is to describe it and write a report on it
you are not supposed to give your opinions
you don't know
why the line on a graph goes up or goes down
you haven't got the research
all you see is the graph and you describe what you see
this we would call a report it's the description task
so no opinions first of all
and another important thing before we get going
I'll just say this now
no conclusion
because a conclusion is like a final opinion
a final judgment
so we're never going to put a conclusion
in writing task one
you can put a summary in writing Task 1
examiners call this the overview
but it's the same as a summary
so if you want to put something general
at the end of your essay
in writing Task 1
let's call it a summary and not a conclusion
so I've said that writing Task 1 is a report
it's a describing task
we have no conclusion but we do have a summary
and we're going to look at
the different types of question
in fact
I'm going to define them as six different types
which I'll show you in a moment
and then I'll give you techniques for those six types
and we'll work on an example question for each one
I said we were going to look at the six question
types for writing task 1
so here they are
line graph bar chart pie chart table
a diagram that's comparing things
or a diagram that's showing a process
I consider a map to be a type of diagram
so maps are included in either No. 5 or number six
now I always ask my students what do numbers 1 to 4
line graph bar chart
pie chart and table have in common
I've highlighted those four in green
because they're very similar
the reason is the answer is that they have
one thing in common
which is that they all show numbers
when you're describing
a line graph bar chart pie chart or table
you're just describing something that shows numbers
people often ask me
is there some special language that I need to know
for pie charts or for tables
the answer is no
there's no special language
the language for those four types is exactly the same
it's number language
and the only things you have to do really
are three things
you might have to describe one number
or
for more than one number you might have to compare
so you need some comparing language
you need to know how to compare numbers in a sentence
and the final thing with numbers
is to be able to describe
changes or trends
that's where you use your increase decrease language
those are the only three things
in terms of language
that we need to really worry about
describing numbers comparing more than one number
and describing these changes and trends
in fact No. 5 the diagram
you're using very similar language
describing and comparing things on a diagram
of course there are no numbers
but the comparing language is gonna be very similar
the only one that has
different language
where you need to use something different
is the process diagram
and we'll talk about that in a lesson
dedicated to the process diagram questions
later in this course
but in terms of language
just remember that it's fairly simple
we've got four types that are all the image.pngsame
just showing numbers
and there's only this one type where we need
to look at some slightly different language
items or structures
moving on from question types to essay structure
I'm going to show you now the 4 paragraph structure
that I always use on my blog my website
and with my students here in Manchester
if you've followed my blog lessons
you should already know this
here are the four paragraphs that I suggest
introduction
overview which you can call summary if you want
the examiners call it an overview
and then two paragraphs of details
no conclusion
you notice I said that earlier in this lesson
but if you want you can put the overview at the end
we can have a summary at the end
I personally prefer to put it second
because I know how important the overview is
for your score
so I do it just after the introduction
but it makes no difference
you can put it at the end as a summary if you want
just don't begin with in conclusion
begin with in summary or
it is clear that
something that shows this is
a general summary of the information
now moving on
the introduction what do we do very simple
one sentence paraphrase the question
so you take the question
and you go through it bit by bit
changing the words if you can maybe change the order
you don't have to change everything
just try to change the keywords in there
anyway moving on the overview or summary what do we do
well my advice is this is very important
so I give it two sentences
and in those two sentences
you're looking to explain or describe
sorry the main general things
so look for two main things two main points
you'll see how
what I mean in more detail when we
actually do some questions later on this course
then finally we have two paragraphs about the details
this is where you include
numbers and you do your comparisons
you're describing trends if there are trends shown
sometimes people ask me why do we need two paragraphs
well the simple answer is
this makes you organize
or group the information better
if you can
for example if you've got numbers you might put all the
higher numbers in one paragraph
and the lower numbers in another
or you might put the first half of the period
in paragraph 3
and the second half of the period of years
in paragraph 4
just grouping and organizing this will help
your score for coherence and cohesion
makes your structure look better
and that's it
no conclusion remember
that's the structure
and I've shown you the types of questions
in the rest of this course we're going to go through
those different question types
so next lesson next week
we will start with the line graph question
