The line diagram illustrates  the comparison of electricity production among 4 sources in France from 1980 to 2012. 

Overall,  Nuclear station's production has experienced a significant increase , starting from about 55 TW-h to around 400 in the past 22 years. While other three sources remained relatively stable.

In 1980, Thermal station played  the most important role in electricity production, In contrast, Renewables was the least important one. Meanwhile, Nuclear and Hydroelectric were in the middle. Shortly After, Thermal saw a share decrease , it dropped from 120 to only 50 by 1985. Meanwhile, Nuclear shown an opposite trend, it increased dramatically to over 200 in 1985. 

Nuclear has kept its upward trend in electricity production, reaching the peak at 430 Tw-h in 2005. By contrast, Renewables remained stable around, it witnessed a slight increase after 2005.  Thermal was suppressed by Hydroelectric since 1985. Hydroelectric remained relatively stable within a range of 50 to 60.
