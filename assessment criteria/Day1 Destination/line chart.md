What's Line graphs?
It shows numbers changing over a period of time. 
So, you will always see the numbers on the y-axis and the time on the x-axis.
and the line in the paragraph shows the numbers changing  going up and down as the time goes on. 

One thing to know:
You will not see a graph with only one line. You will almost definitly see 2, 3,4 or 5 lines .

Your job: 
Your job is to compare the lines, not describe them separately.  

Two types of comparasion:
1. First , make a very general comparison. 

Where you can put it ? 
You can put it in the overview paragraph. 

Example: 
line.png 
The blue line is the highest overall, is higher than the other lines.

2. Second, compare the lines at specific points

Where you can put it ? 
This is for your details paragraphs. 

Example: 
line.png 
You can start off at the beginning with the first year and compare the numbers there. 
You have to select what you think the main things. 

What main things mean ? 
1. The intersection of the lines. 
2. The peaks on one or more of the lines.  
3. The difference increases or rises. 
4. The stable period on one the lines 
There are many things to say, But you can't describe everything. 

The tip to select the main things:
Write at least one thing about each line.  
Make sure you do some comparison. 


Example: line_practice.png 
Paragraph 1: Introduction:          

[first draft:]
The line graph displays the change of source of enery in electricity production (in terawatt hours)
in France from 1980 to 2012. 

[Mistakes I made: ]
1. editing while writing, which makes me hestitate and lose my flow. 


[Simon's advice about how to paraphrase the question:]
1. part of speech (noun -> adjective)
electricity production -> the amount of electricity produced.

2. synonymons 
The graph -> The line graph 

3. general -> concrete 
shows -> compares 

4. 0 -> 1 [you can add something not metioned in the title but in the graph]
using four difference sources of power

5. 1 -> 0
(in terawatt hours) -> 

6. the range of time  [time points -> duration]
between 1980 and 2012 -> over a period of 32 years. 

7. location 
can stay the same. 



Paragraph2: Overview - 2 sentences, 2 main points 

[first draft:]
The Nuclear hash suprassesed all in proudction since 1981 and reached its highest peak about 430 TW-h in 2005. Theremal was the highest before 1980,but it 
experienced an gradual decrease and remained in a relateively stable fluctuation aroud 30 to 50 TW-h after 1985.  For Hydroelectric, it remained stable ranging  from 50 to 70. The Renewables with the lowest production at all time. 

[Mistakes I made]
1. what should be written in the overview ?  [selecting 2 main points is enough]
2. gramma mistakes: the usage 
3. without transition phrases
4. lexical resources. 


[Simon's advice about how to do comparison]
1. highest and the opposite (lowest)
It is clear that nuclear power was by far the most imporatnt means of electricy generation over the period shown. 
Renewables provided the lowest amount of electricty in each year. 

optimization [synonymons]
the highest -> the most important means 


Pargrahp3: Details 
[First draft: ]
In 1980, Thermal had the highest production about 120 TW-h. Nuclear and Hydroelectric were the same ,Renewables was the lowest. 
In 1981ï¼Œ Nuclear becames important over any other sources and remained highest over the period. 


[Mistakes I made:]
1. subject + verb :https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1xM4m1m7GY?t=602.0&p=2    [******]


[Simon's advice about how to do comparison]
1. what's outstanding ? a good structure to display: time, location, role [in enery production], features. 
 In 1980, thermal power stations were the main source of electrity in France, generating around 120 terawatt hours of power.

2. what shoule be compared ?  the role, the features [the number of power] . 
Nuclear and hydroelectric power stations produced just under 75 terawatt hours of electricity each, and renewables provided a negligible amount.

3. what should be compared ?  the change [in the contricution (the production ability)] 
Just one year later, nuclear power overtook thermal power as the primary source of electricity.



Pargrahp4: Details 
[First draft: ]



[Mistakes I made:]


[Simon's advice about how to do comparison]
1. Between 1980 and 2005, electricity production from nuclear power rose dramatically to a peak of 430 terawatt hours. 

2. By contrast, the figure for thermal power fell to only 50 terawatt hourse in  1985, and remained at this level for the rest of the period.

3. Hydroelectric power generation remained relatively stable, at between 50and 80 terawatt hourse ,for the whole 32-year period. 

4. But renewable electricity production saw only a small rise to approprixity 25 terawatt hourse by 2012.
