A conclusion appears to involve opinions, judgments, or final thoughts

A summary/overview simply describes the general trends or main features of the data without adding opinions

If placed at the end, don't begin with "in conclusion" - instead use phrases like:
"in summary"
"it is clear that"
Other phrases that indicate a general summary of information
